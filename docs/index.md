# Welcome
Welcome to the Onyku® open source project website.  
This is a work in progress.
The website is based on MkDocs, but this may change in the future.  
Information from [Calvet IT](https://calvetit.com/onyku/) and the [Onyku® open source project](https://github.com/CalvetIT/onyku) will be migrated here later.

On the navigation bar you will find the section pre-providers.
Currently, these are 'Pre-providers' as the Onyku® standards are not yet defined.
Each link will redirect to the GitHub Page of the relevant repository.

Official providers are created and maintained by Calvet IT, while partner providers are managed by partners. Inspired by [Terraform](https://registry.terraform.io/browse/providers), this approach focuses on Open Knowledge rather than Infrastructure as Code.

If you are interested in shaping Onyku® standards, please join the Onyku® community on slack.
[Contact us](https://calvetit.com/contact-us/) to get an invitation.
